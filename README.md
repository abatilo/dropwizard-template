I like using Dropwizard as my http server as choice. I use it a lot and every
time, I copy common files from other projects. I figure I might as well make a
template for getting started.

## Getting Started

Run `make help` to get started:
```
â‡’  make help
help                           View help information
test                           Runs tests
run                            Run the application locally
build                          Builds a container
clean                          Deletes used containers and volumes
```

## Operations

### Healthchecks
Healthchecks are available at:
```
curl http://localhost:8081/healthcheck
```

### Metrics
Prometheus format metrics are available at:
```
curl http://localhost:8081/metrics-text
```

**Note**: The metrics server is running on a different servlet than the main application
to mitigate any interference.
